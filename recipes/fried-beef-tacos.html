<h2>Description</h2>
<p>These crispy fried beef tacos—sometimes called "Arizona Tacos"— are having a moment on TikTok.<br>
    You press the raw meat onto the tortilla before frying the whole thing for the ultimate crunchy<br>
    exterior with a tender, juicy filling. And they're easy to make—here's how.</p>
    <br>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>8 (5-inch) corn tortillas</li>
    <li>1 pound ground sirloin</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons taco seasoning</li>
    <li>3/4 teaspoon kosher salt, divided</li>
    <li>1/2 cup vegetable oil, or as needed for frying</li>
    <li>1/2 cup minced white onion</li>
    <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro</li>
    <li>lime wedges, for serving</li>
    <li>1/4 cup salsa, or as needed, for serving</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
    <li>Lay 8 tortillas flat on a surface.</li>
    <li>Combine beef, taco seasoning,<br>and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a medium bowl.</li>
    <li>Press 1/4 cup of beef mixture onto half of each tortilla.</li>
    <li>Heat 1/4-inch of oil in a high-sided skillet over medium heat<br>
        until shimmering. Working in batches, carefully add one<br>
        taco at the time, flat, to the hot oil.</li>
    <li>Hold empty side of the tortilla with a pair of tongs, and fold<br>
        over beef filling once the shell is softened, about 5 seconds.</li>
    <li>Cook, turning once, until shell is golden brown and beef is<br>
        no longer pink in the center, 30 seconds to 1 minute per<br>
        side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center<br>
        should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Transfer to a paper towel/lined plate, and sprinkle with<br>
        remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt.</li>
    <li>Serve immediately topped with onion and cilantro.<br>
        Serve with lime wedges, salsa, and hot sauce.</li>
