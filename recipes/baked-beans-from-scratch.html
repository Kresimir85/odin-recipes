        </p>
        <br>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup navy beans, soaked overnight and drained</li>
            <li>4 cups water</li>
            <li>1/4 cup ketchup</li>
            <li>1/4 cup maple syrup</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons molasses</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon chili powder</li>
            <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place beans in a large saucepan with 4 cups of water. Bring<br>
                to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low,<br>
                cover, and simmer 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Stir<br>
                ketchup, maple syrup, brown sugar, molasses,<br>
                Worcestershire sauce, salt, pepper, and chili powder<br>
                together in a small bowl; set aside.</li>
            <li>Once beans have simmered for 1 hour, drain, and reserve<br>
                cooking liquid. Pour beans into a 1 1/2-quart casserole dish;<br>
                stir in chopped onion and molasses mixture. Stir in enough<br>
                reserved cooking liquid so sauce covers beans by 1/4 inch.</li>
            <li>Cover and bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes;<br>
                reduce heat to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C) and cook 6<br>
                hours longer, stirring beans after they have cooked for 3<br>
                hours. Once beans are tender and sauce has reduced and is<br>
                sticky, remove from the oven, stir, recover, and allow to stand<br>
                15 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
